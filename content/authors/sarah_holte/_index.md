Dr. Holte's primary interests include biostatistics and biomathematics and in particular, the interplay between the two. Her specific interests involve identifying, developing and evaluating statistical approaches that can be used in combination with mathematical models defined by differential equations for viral and immune system dynamics. Dr. Holte also serve as Director for the CFAR Biometrics Core.

Dr. Holte specializes in the analysis of nonlinear time series data and estimation and inference for parameters in differential equations models. She's the PI of an R21 designed to create a large database of individuals enrolled in studies during acute HIV infection. This requires careful database design. Her ultimate goal is to have many groups contribute to the database so that it is possible to evaluate a large cohort for prevalence and associates of Post-Treatment Control of HIV infection.
