I started the HIV Virulence Trends Working Group, a collaboration with multiple international HIV cohorts from North America, Europe and Africa, with the goal of better understanding how HIV evolves in human populations. We are funded by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (www.nescent.org). This collaboration has the potential to change how we understand the last 50 years of HIV evolution in humans, how cohorts around the world collect and record clinical and virological data, and how scientists model future trends in HIV epidemiology and evolution.
