      title: Our current work
      subtitle: Identify HIV clusters using real time, streaming case-report data from the WA DOH.
      text: |
        - Rapidly identify spatial/temporal clusters from individuals who seek health care. 
        - We will use case report rather than phylogenetics to significantly reduce the time to identifying clusters and obtain significantly fewer missing cases but will lose the transmission chain. 
        - Therefore, we aim to combine our approach with transmission/phylogeny whenever available. 
        - Rigorous assessment and comparison is major part of the ongoing research.
