abstract: In point-based sensing systems such as coordinate measuring machines and
  laser ultrasonics where complete sensing is impractical due to the high sensing
  time and cost, adaptive sensing through a systematic exploration is vital for online
  inspection and anomaly quantification. Most of the existing sequential sampling
  methodologies focus on reducing the overall fitting error for the entire sampling
  space. However, in many anomaly quantification applications, the main goal is to
  estimate sparse anomalous regions at pixel-level accurately. In this article, we
  develop a novel framework named Adaptive Kernelized Maximum-Minimum Distance (AKM2D)
  to speed up the inspection and anomaly detection process through an intelligent
  sequential sampling scheme integrated with fast estimation and detection. The proposed
  method balances the sampling efforts between the space-filling sampling (exploration)
  and focused sampling near the anomalous region (exploitation). The proposed methodology
  is validated by conducting simulations and a case study of anomaly detection in
  composite sheets using a guided wave test.
