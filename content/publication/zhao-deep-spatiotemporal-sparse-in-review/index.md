abstract: Electrical conduction among cardiac tissue is commonly modeled with partial
  differential equations, i.e., reaction-diffusion equation, where the reaction term
  describes cellular stimulation and diffusion term describes electrical propagation.
  Detecting and identification of cardiac cells that produce abnormal electrical impulses
  in such nonlinear dynamic systems are important for efficient treatment and planning.
  To model the nonlinear dynamics, simulation has been widely used in both cardiac
  research and clinical study to investigate cardiac disease mechanisms and develop
  new treatment design. However, existing cardiac models have a great level of complexity,
  and the simulation is often time-consuming. We propose a deep spatio-temporal sparse
  decomposition (DSTSD) approach to bypass the time-consuming cardiac partial differential
  equations with the deep spatio-temporal model and to detect the time and location
  of the anomaly (i.e., malfunctioning cardiac cells). This approach is validated
  from the data set generated from the Courtemanche-Ramirez-Nattel (CRN) model, which
  is widely used to model the propagation of the transmembrane potential across the
  cross the neuron membrane. The proposed DSTSD achieved the best accuracy in terms
  of spatio-temporal mean trend prediction and anomaly detection.
