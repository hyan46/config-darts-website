@article{yanAKM2DAdaptiveFramework2020,
	abstract = {In point-based sensing systems such as coordinate measuring machines and laser ultrasonics where complete sensing is impractical due to the high sensing time and cost, adaptive sensing through a systematic exploration is vital for online inspection and anomaly quantification. Most of the existing sequential sampling methodologies focus on reducing the overall fitting error for the entire sampling space. However, in many anomaly quantification applications, the main goal is to estimate sparse anomalous regions at pixel-level accurately. In this article, we develop a novel framework named Adaptive Kernelized Maximum-Minimum Distance (AKM2D) to speed up the inspection and anomaly detection process through an intelligent sequential sampling scheme integrated with fast estimation and detection. The proposed method balances the sampling efforts between the space-filling sampling (exploration) and focused sampling near the anomalous region (exploitation). The proposed methodology is validated by conducting simulations and a case study of anomaly detection in composite sheets using a guided wave test.},

@article{yanAnomalyDetectionImages2017,
	abstract = {In various manufacturing applications such as steel, composites, and textile production, anomaly detection in noisy images is of special importance. Although there are several methods for image denoising and anomaly detection, most of these perform denoising and detection sequentially, which affects detection accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, the low computational speed of some of these methods is a limitation for real-time inspection. In this article, we develop a novel methodology for anomaly detection in noisy images with smooth backgrounds. The proposed method, named smooth-sparse decomposition, exploits regularized high-dimensional regression to decompose an image and separate anomalous regions by solving a large-scale optimization problem. To enable the proposed method for real-time implementation, a fast algorithm for solving the optimization model is proposed. Using simulations and a case study, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with existing methods. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the detection accuracy as well as computation time. This article has supplementary materials that includes all the technical details, proofs, MATLAB codes, and simulated images used in the article.},

@article{yanImagebasedProcessMonitoring2015,
	abstract = {Image and video sensors are increasingly being deployed in complex systems due to the rich process information that these sensors can capture. As a result, image data play an important role in process monitoring and control in different application domains such as manufacturing processes, food industries, medical decision-making, and structural health monitoring. Existing process monitoring techniques fail to fully utilize the information of color images due to their complex data characteristics including the high-dimensionality and correlation structure (i.e., temporal, spatial and spectral correlation). This paper proposes a new image-based process monitoring approach that is capable of handling both grayscale and color images. The proposed approach models the high-dimensional structure of the image data with tensors and employs low-rank tensor decomposition techniques to extract important monitoring features monitored using multivariate control charts. In addition, this paper shows the analytical relationships between different low-rank tensor decomposition methods. The performance of the proposed method in quick detection of process changes is evaluated and compared with existing methods through extensive simulations and a case study in a steel tube manufacturing process. Note to Practitioners - This paper, motivated by the problem of combustion monitoring in steel tube manufacturing, focuses on the development of effective methods for process monitoring based on image data. Existing process monitoring techniques cannot fully utilize the information of color images due to the high-dimensionality and complex correlation structure of such data. This paper addresses this problem by extracting essential monitoring features, while considering the spatial and spectral correlation of color images. This is accomplished by using various low-rank tensor decomposition methods along with multivariate control charts. The proposed approach can lead to a computer-aided online monitoring system for automatic detection of out-of-control situations in a process. Using simulation, the performance of the developed methods is compared under various scenarios. This can provide practitioners with useful guidelines for selecting an appropriate method for image-based process monitoring. In future research, we will study the development of image-based fault diagnosis techniques that can be integrated with the process monitoring approaches proposed in this paper.},

@inproceedings{yanPhysicsbasedDeepSpatiotemporal2019,
	abstract = {Modeling and simulation have been widely used in both cardiac research and clinical study to investigate cardiac disease mechanism and develop new treatment design. Electrical conduction among cardiac tissue is commonly modeled with a partial differential equation, i.e., reaction-diffusion equation, where the reaction term describes cellular excitation and diffusion term describes electrical propagation. Cellular excitation can be modeled by either detailed human cellular models or simplified models such as the FitzHugh-Nagumo model; electrical propagation can be simulated using either biodomain or mono-domain tissue model. However, existing cardiac models have a great level of complexity, and the simulation is often time-consuming. This paper develops a new spatiotemporal model as a surrogate model of the timeconsuming cardiac model. Specifically, we propose to investigate the auto-regressive convolutional neural network (AR-CNN) and convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) to model the spatial and temporal structure for the metamodeling. Model predictions are compared to the one-dimensional simulation data to validate the prediction accuracy. The metamodel can accurately capture the properties of the individual cardiac cell, as well as the electrical wave morphology in cardiac fiber at different simulation scenarios, which demonstrates its superior performance in modeling and the long-term prediction.},

@article{yanRealtimeDetectionClustered2021,
	abstract = {The use of video-imaging data for in-line process monitoring applications has become more and more popular in the industry. In this framework, spatio-temporal statistical process monitoring methods are needed to capture the relevant information content and signal possible out-of-control states. Video-imaging data are characterized by a spatio-temporal variability structure that depends on the underlying phenomenon, and typical out-of-control patterns are related to the events that are localized both in time and space. In this paper, we propose an integrated spatio-temporal decomposition and regression approach for anomaly detection in video-imaging data. Out-of-control events are typically sparse spatially clustered and temporally consistent. Therefore, the goal is to not only detect the anomaly as quickly as possible ("when") but also locate it ("where"). The proposed approach works by decomposing the original spatio-temporal data into random natural events, sparse spatially clustered and temporally consistent anomalous events, and random noise. Recursive estimation procedures for spatio-temporal regression are presented to enable the real-time implementation of the proposed methodology. Finally, a likelihood ratio test procedure is proposed to detect when and where the hotspot happens. The proposed approach was applied to the analysis of video-imaging data to detect and locate local over-heating phenomena ("hotspots") during the layer-wise process in a metal additive manufacturing process.},

@article{yanRealTimeMonitoringHighDimensional2018,
	abstract = {High-dimensional data monitoring and diagnosis has recently attracted increasing attention among researchers as well as practitioners. However, existing process monitoring methods fail to fully use the information of high-dimensional data streams due to their complex characteristics including the large dimensionality, spatio-temporal correlation structure, and nonstationarity. In this article, we propose a novel process monitoring methodology for high-dimensional data streams including profiles and images that can effectively address foregoing challenges. We introduce spatio-temporal smooth sparse decomposition (ST-SSD), which serves as a dimension reduction and denoising technique by decomposing the original tensor into the functional mean, sparse anomalies, and random noises. ST-SSD is followed by a sequential likelihood ratio test on extracted anomalies for process monitoring. To enable real-time implementation of the proposed methodology, recursive estimation procedures for ST-SSD are developed. ST-SSD also provides useful diagnostics information about the location of change in the functional mean. The proposed methodology is validated through various simulations and real case studies.

@article{zhaoDeepSpatiotemporalSparseInReview,
	abstract = {Electrical conduction among cardiac tissue is commonly modeled with partial differential equations, i.e., reaction-diffusion equation, where the reaction term describes cellular stimulation and diffusion term describes electrical propagation. Detecting and identification of cardiac cells that produce abnormal electrical impulses in such nonlinear dynamic systems are important for efficient treatment and planning. To model the nonlinear dynamics, simulation has been widely used in both cardiac research and clinical study to investigate cardiac disease mechanisms and develop new treatment design. However, existing cardiac models have a great level of complexity, and the simulation is often time-consuming. We propose a deep spatio-temporal sparse decomposition (DSTSD) approach to bypass the time-consuming cardiac partial differential equations with the deep spatio-temporal model and to detect the time and location of the anomaly (i.e., malfunctioning cardiac cells). This approach is validated from the data set generated from the Courtemanche-Ramirez-Nattel (CRN) model, which is widely used to model the propagation of the transmembrane potential across the cross the neuron membrane. The proposed DSTSD achieved the best accuracy in terms of spatio-temporal mean trend prediction and anomaly detection.},

@inproceedings{zhaoRapidDetectionHotspot2019,
	abstract = {In many bio-surveillance and healthcare applications, data sources are measured from many spatial locations repeatedly over time, say, daily/weekly/monthly. In these applications, we are typically interested in detecting hot-spots, which are defined as some structured outliers that are sparse over the spatial domain but persistent over time. In this paper, we propose a tensor decomposition method to detect when and where the hot-spots occur. Our proposed methods represent the observed raw data as a three-dimensional tensor including a circular time dimension for daily/weekly/monthly patterns, and then decompose the tensor into three components: smooth global trend, local hot-spots, and residuals. A combination of LASSO and fused LASSO is used to estimate the model parameters, and a CUSUM procedure is applied to detect when and where the hot-spots might occur. The usefulness of our proposed methodology is validated through numerical simulation and a real-world dataset in the weekly number of gonorrhea cases from \$2006\$ to \$2018\$ for \$50\$ states in the United States.},

@article{zhaoRapidDetectionHotspots2021,
	abstract = {We propose an efficient statistical method (denoted as SSR-Tensor) to robustly and quickly detect hot-spots that are sparse and temporal-consistent in a spatial-temporal dataset through the tensor decomposition. Our main idea is to first build an SSR model to decompose the tensor data into a Smooth global trend mean, Sparse local hot-spots and Residuals. Next, tensor decomposition is utilized as follows: basis are introduced to describe within-dimension correlation and tensor products are used for between-dimension interaction. Then, a combination of LASSO and fused LASSO is used to estimate the model parameters, where an efficient recursive estimation procedure is developed based on the large-scale convex optimization, where we first transform the general LASSO optimization into regular LASSO optimization and apply FISTA to solve it with the fastest convergence rate. Finally, a CUSUM procedure is applied to detect when and where the hot-spot event occurs. We compare the performance of the proposed method in a numerical simulation and a real-world dataset, which is a collection of three types of crime rates for U.S. mainland states during the year 1965-2014. In both cases, the proposed SSR-Tensor is able to achieve the fast detection and accurate localization of the hot-spots.},
